> docker nginx image

Small-Secure-Fast docker nginx image.  
Base image is alpine, which is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution. Most response headers are concealed, and DDoS mitigation is equipped. You should use secure headers included in `conf.d` for further safety considerations. Additionally, nginx caching parameters are optimized.  
This image is automatically released by Docker Cloud.
